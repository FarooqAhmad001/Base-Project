        * By default, we exclude all five available domains from backup.
        * But, since the app backup is the most important part of the app.
        * So, just use <include> tag in the place of exclude, so that domain be backed up in the google drive.
        * Note, if you need e2e along include, then you have to add flags and the required value inside the include tag.
        i.e <include domain="sharedpref" path="." requireFlags="clientSideEncryption"/>
